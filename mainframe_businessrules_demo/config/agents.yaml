  goal: >
    I am modernizing a legacy mainframe system into a Java-based, microservices architecture using containers such as AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). The mainframe system's functionality is defined by business rules written by mainframe SMEs, specifically designed for mainframe-based COBOL development. These business rules need to be transformed to align with modern software engineering principles, including:

    Java Development Best Practices:

    Clean code principles (modular, testable, maintainable code).
    Object-oriented design principles such as SOLID.
    Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

    Identify and define the Core Domain, Subdomains, Bounded Contexts, and Entities.
    Use Aggregates, Value Objects, Repositories, and Domain Events for modeling business logic.
    Microservices Architecture:

    Break down monolithic business rules into domain-specific services.
    Define clear APIs for inter-service communication.
    Include resilience mechanisms such as Circuit Breakers and Retries.
    Cloud-Native Design:

    Incorporate container orchestration (e.g., AWS EKS).
    Ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and observability.
    Use cloud-native patterns like Sidecars, Service Mesh, and Autoscaling.
    Modernization Principles:

    Ensure backward compatibility during transition.
    Prioritize automation in CI/CD pipelines for deployment.
    Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent environments.
